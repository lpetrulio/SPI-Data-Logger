# SPI High-Speed Data Logger – Arty A7-100T FPGA  

## Project Overview  
This FPGA-based **SPI High-Speed Data Logger** captures real-time temperature data from a **thermocouple sensor** using SPI communication and writes it to an **SD card** for later analysis. The system is optimized for **low latency, high-speed data acquisition, and efficient storage**.

## Features  
- **SPI Interface**: Communicates with a thermocouple sensor (e.g., MAX31855) for temperature readings.  
- **High-Speed Data Logging**: Captures and stores temperature data in real time.  
- **SD Card Storage**: Writes logged data to an SD card 
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Uses **FIFO buffering and pipelining** to handle continuous data flow.  
- **UART Debug Interface**: Displays real-time temperature readings via a UART terminal.  
- **Optimized for Timing & Performance**: Implements **clock domain crossing (CDC), timing closure, and latency optimization**.
